I developed this project, while taking the Maven:  Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence in Udemy. The course was a project-based course, designed with a practical and hands-on approach to learn business intelligence with Power BI Desktop.


### The Situation

Adventure Works Cycles, a global manufacturing company needed an end-to-end business intelligence solution â€“ *from scratch*!


They need to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and forecast, and identify high-value customers.

All that was given was a folder of raw csv files, containing information about transitions, returns, products, customers and territories.

### The Objetive

Use Power BI Desktop to:

- Connect and transform the raw data
- Build a relational data model
- Create new calculated columnsand DAX measures
- Design an interactive report to analyze and visualize the data
